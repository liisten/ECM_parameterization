modelC1.mat file is created by bulidModel.m and further updated by idtfRCParam_IGWO.m.
Specifically, in buildModel.m, the OCV, hysteresis related parameters are initialized, 
and in idtfRCParam_IGWO.m, the RC related parameters are obtained by IGWO algorithm.
the specific structure can be found in buildModel.m file.
